    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      To begin with, we first familiarized ourselves with the PageRank algorithm and the various methods to implement it. We implemented a simple baseline version of the code which is based on serial page rank calculation. It uses the power method iteratively, until the matrix columns representing each webpageâ€™s incoming page ranks converge.

      There are several publicly available datasets and we chose to go with the Google, Stanford and Berkeley web graphs available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#web. As they are publicly available, we will be able to cross verify the correctness of our implementation.
