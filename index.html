    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>We aim to implement the page rank algorithm using the graph data structure in parallel with the help of concepts taught in class like data parallel, shared memory and message passing models, specifically MPI. The performance will be compared against existing serial implementations.</p>
    <h2> Background </h2>
    <p>The PageRank algorithm was developed by Google in 1999 which provides an insight into how the internet can be thought of as a graph. 
      The algorithm envisages the internet as a directed graph with unweighted edges. 
      Each node of the graph represents a webpage and links between two webpages are denoted by a link. Each node receives a score based on its ‘importance’. Pages with high-quality content should receive higher scores than pages with low-quality content. With the ever growing size of the internet, the number of pages is growing at an exponential rate. 
        Such an application will greatly benefit from parallel processing</p>
    <h2> Heading of the paragraph </h2>
    <p>This is an example paragraph. Anything in the <strong>body</strong> tag will appear on the page, just like this <strong>p</strong> tag and its contents.</p>
